# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please report them to our private vulnerability disclosure program.

We will make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.

## Policy

- Do not include secrets in examples.
- Endpoints that accept files are validated; clients should prefer multipart for large media.
